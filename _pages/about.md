Hi! I'm Qihao He (何其好). I'm a senior undergraduate student at the [School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences](https://www.psy.pku.edu.cn/index.htm), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn). 
My research lies at the intersection of high-level vision and cognition. I'm interested in how humans perceive, process and reason about complex visual information in natural and dynamic real-world environments. I use behavioral, psychophysical, computational and neuroimaging techniques to investigate how visual perception interacts with memory and cognitive control, ultimately seeking to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying human intelligence.

Outside of research, I love Chinese calligraphy, photography, figure skating, running, and reading.

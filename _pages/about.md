Hi! I'm Qihao He (何其好). I'm a senior undergraduate student from [School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences](https://www.psy.pku.edu.cn/index.htm) at [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn). 
My research lies at the intersection of high-level vision and cognition. I'm interested in how human perceive, process and reason about complex visual information in natural and dynamic real-world environments. I use behavioral, psychophysical, computational and neuroimaging techniques to investigate how visual perception interacts with memory and cognitive control, ultimately seek to understand the cognitive mechanism of human intelligence.

Outside of research, I love Chinese caligraphy, photography, figure skating, running, and reading.

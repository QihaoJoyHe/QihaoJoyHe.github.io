Hi! I'm **Qihao He (何其好)**. I'm a senior undergraduate student at the [School of Psychological and Cognitive Sciences](https://www.psy.pku.edu.cn/index.htm), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn). 

My research lies at the intersection of **high-level vision and cognition**. I'm interested in how humans perceive, process and reason about complex visual information in natural and dynamic real-world environments. I use **behavioral, psychophysical, computational and neuroimaging techniques** to investigate how visual perception interacts with memory and cognitive control, ultimately seeking to understand the cognitive mechanisms underlying human intelligence.

During my undergraduate years, I've been lucky to explore a wide range of topics in visual cognition: **Scene Perception & Spatial Navigation** (with [Prof. Sheng Li](https://www.psy.pku.edu.cn/szdw/qzjy/jsyjy/ls/index.htm), PKU), **Facial Expression Perception** (with [Prof. Yujia Peng](https://www.ypeng.org), PKU), **Face Identity Perception & Human-AI Comparison** (with [Prof. Zili Liu](https://zililab.psych.ucla.edu), UCLA), and **Confidence & Metacognitive Training** (with [Prof. Dobromir Rahnev](https://rahnevlab.gatech.edu/index.html), Georgia Tech). While they may seem a bit *all over the map*, these independent projects have really broaden my horizons and sharpened my sense for methodology and scientific thinking! See Research for details. 

You can find my CV here: [Qihao He's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/CV_QihaoHe.pdf) (updated in Oct 2025). 

Outside of research, I love Chinese calligraphy, photography, figure skating, running, and reading.

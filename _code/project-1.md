## Overview

This repository contains the MATLAB and C# experiment code for the **PanoNavigation project**, which investigated individuals utilize multi-level spatial cues to construct and shift between global-local reference frames during spatial navigation. 

Experiment 1 (Panorama) was implemented with **Psychtoolbox** and **MATLAB**, presenting panoramic street scenes which participants could view freely in learning phase using keyboad. 
Experiment 2 (Virtual City) was implemented with **Unity** and **C#**, presenting a game interface where participants could navigate in the city following the intructions.

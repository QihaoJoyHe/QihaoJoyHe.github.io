## Overview

This repository contains the js online experiment code for the **Optimal Confidence project**, which investigated whether trial-level optimal confidence feedback can enhance metacognitive calibration in perceptual decision-making.

The experiment was implemented with **jsPsych** and **JavaScript**, presenting a two-alternative visual discrimination task with adaptive confidence feedback generated from **Monte Carlo simulations**. The simulation was implemented with **MATLAB** to generate confidence lookup table.

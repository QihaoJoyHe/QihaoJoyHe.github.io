## Overview

This repository contains the MATLAB experiment code for the **FaceAU project**, which investigated how individuals with high and low social anxiety process dynamic facial information using a reverse correlation paradigm.

The experiment was implemented with **Psychtoolbox** and **MATLAB**, presenting dynamically generated facial stimuli based on **FACS action units** and **Generative Model of 3D Faces (GMF)** parameters.

### Overview
This project examined how individuals utilize multi-level spatial cues to construct and shift between **global-local reference frames** ([Marchette et al., 2014](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.3834)) during spatial navigation in naturalistic environments. We employed the Judgment of Relative Direction (JRD) paradigm ([Huffman & Ekstrom, 2019](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13875868.2018.1531869)) using **panoramic street scenes** (Exp 1) and a **virtual environment** (Exp 2). Ongoing fMRI work (Exp 3) aims to further explore how scene-selective brain areas, especially retrosplenial cortex (RSC; [Epstein & Baker, 2019](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-vision-091718-014809)), support these reference frame shifts. 

### *Experiment 1a & b: Panorama*
We examined how **local street layout** and **global directional alignment** influence heading within a single panoramic intersectionÔºàusing [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps/) and [iStreetView](https://svd360.com/)). Participants freely explored panoramic street scenes in learning and later performed JRD tasks based on cropped views.
*Exp 1a* employed **regular** (cross) layouts, while *Exp 1b* used **irregular** ones. Results showed that regular layout enhanced local reference frame use (stronger alignment effects), whereas irregular layouts increased reliance on global direction. These findings suggest that local layout regularity facilitates local frame adoption.

### *Experiment 2: Virtual City*
Building on Exp 1a, we further constructed a large-scale virtual city based on [Unity](https://unity.com/) comprising three blocks whose local street layouts differed in **alignment** (0¬∞, 22.5¬∞, 45¬∞) with the global north. Participants navigated the city and learned target intersections, performing two-level JRD tasks probing both **global** (between intersections) and **local** (within intersections) headings. Consistent with Exp 1a, alignment effects emerged in local JRDs, whereas global JRDs were modulated by layout misalignment, where global reference frames dominated when navigating between distinct local structures (block layouts). These results highlight interactive encoding between local geometry and global spatial reference, implicating the RSC in mediating reference frame shifts for the ongoing fMRI study in Exp 3.

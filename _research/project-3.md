### Overview
This project examined how **human** and **deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs)** process facial identity across two distinct paradigms: **twins identification** and **age-related face memory**. By comparing psychometric performance (Signal Detection Theory, SDT; Area Under the ROC Curve, AUC), we sought to identify where and how human and machine representations diverge in face processing.

### *Study 1: Twins Identification*
We investigated whether humans and AI models rely on similar cues when distinguishing *same person*, *identical twins*, *fraternal twins*, and *doppelgangers* under varying levels of **adversarial distortion** generated by [Fawkes](https://sandlab.cs.uchicago.edu/fawkes/). Participants viewed pairs of faces and rated whether they depicted the same person. Deep learning models (e.g., [DeepFace](https://github.com/serengil/deepface), ) were tuned for parallel testing. Results revealed that human accuracy degraded more gradually with increasing distortion.

### *Study 2: Age-Related Face Memory*
We explored human‚Äìmachine differences in **face memory across age** using the [MORPH Longitudinal Database](https://uncw.edu/research/innovation/commercialization/technology-portfolio/morph). Participants first learned a set of faces and later judged whether test faces were *‚Äúold‚Äù* or *‚Äúnew‚Äù*. We compared two task instructions: in the **identity** condition, participants judged whether the test face was the same person; in the **image** condition, they judged whether it was the same image. Results found that despite being instructed to focus on low-level image features, participants misclassified more new images of the same individual (different ages) as "old", revealing **automatic identity encoding** beyond surface-level perception.

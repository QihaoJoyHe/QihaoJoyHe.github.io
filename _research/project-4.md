### Overview
This project explored whether **trial-level optimal confidence feedback** can improve metacognitive calibration in perceptual decision-making more effectively than traditional correct/incorrect feedback ([Haddara & Rahnev, 2022](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/09567976211032887)). We implemented Monte Carlo simulations to combine task difficulty and estimated internal noise ([Sanders et al., 2016](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2016.03.025)), generating optimal confidence feedback for each trial. Pre- and post-training sessions were analyzed using Signal Detection Theory (SDT) to assess changes in perceptual sensitivity (dâ€™), decision criterion (c), and metacognitive sensitivity (meta-dâ€™).

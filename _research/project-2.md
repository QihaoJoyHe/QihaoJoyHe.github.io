### Overview
This project investigated how individuals with high and low social anxiety (SA) levels process dynamic facial information when judging positive (happy) and negative (angry) emotions. We used a **reverse correlation** ([Dotsch & Todorov, 2012](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1948550611430272))technique combined with a **Generative Model of 3D Faces (GMF)** ([Yu et al., 2012](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0097849311001695); [Chen et al., 2024](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982223016561)) based on the **Facial Action Coding System (FACS)** (Ekman & Friesen, 1978) to construct dynamic facial stimuli varying in facial action unites (AUs). Participants viewed dynamic faces and judged whether the emotion displayed was *Happy*, *Angry*, or *Other*. 

Despite comparable overall accuracy, RT, sensitivity (d‚Äô), and bias (c), trial-level mixed modeling revealed that high SA individuals showed weaker modulation of diagnostic AUs for both emotions (AU9 nose wrinkler, for angry; AU12 lip-corner puller and AU25 lips part, for happy) and achieved higher accuracy under lower amplitude or delayed cues, suggesting enhanced sensitivity under ambiguity. Template reconstruction further suggested smaller intensity of diagnostic AUs in high SA, indicating emotional judgments with less sensory evidence. This study provides a quantitative framework that bridges behavioral modeling and internal representations, offering new insights into the mechanisms of maladaptive social cognition.

### Overview
This project investigated how individuals with high and low levels of social anxiety process dynamic facial information when judging positive and negative emotions.  
We used a **reverse correlation** technique combined with a **Generative Model of 3D Faces (GMF)** and the **Facial Action Coding System (FACS)** to construct dynamic facial stimuli varying in facial action unites (FaceAUs).

Participants viewed dynamic faces and judged whether the emotion displayed was *Happy*, *Angry*, or *Other*.  
By analyzing reaction times and accuracy, we inferred the diagnostic facial features participants relied upon, reconstructing individual **perceptual emotion templates**.
